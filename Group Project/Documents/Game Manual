*******************************************************GAME MANUAL*********************************************************************

PHASE 1 -- OPENING/STARTING THE GAME:
	--> In order to begin the University Risk game, open your terminal and type the following command: 
		           styx> java -jar CollegeConquest-j.jar NAME NAME NAME
	    Where 'NAME' is the name of a player who would like to play. You play with anywhere from 2 to 20 number of players.
	--> When the game opens (you will be able to see the game board) select the 'Menu' in the upper left corner. You will see a drop
	    down menu which is where you should select 'Play.'
	--> You should now see several pop-up windows - one for each player that you entered above. From here you should select, in order
	    of player number, the color you wish to assign to each player. Once this is completed you will see another pop-up-indicating
	    that the game has started
	   
PHASE 2 -- GAMEPLAY AND RULES:
	--> As soon as the game begins, you will see several different colors behind the numbers on the game board. Do not be confused as this simply
		denotes ownership or power over a department or school. If Player One's color is red, and he is chair of a department, that department will 
		appear red. NOTE: Do not confuse the common school color with a player color. Each school has a unique color for its four departments. 
		If a color is behind the department name, it represents the school color. If a color is behind a number, it represents the player who 
		chairs that department.
	--> If it is your turn, you will see a box on the right side of the screen displaying your player color, the number of players
	    that you are YET TO ASSIGN to a department, the number of departments that you chair, and the number of schools that you
	    are dean of. Also, you will see a field that indicates which "Step" you are on. The "Steps" are defined as follows:
	   		
	   		*Put Students: This is the time for you to assign your unassigned students to the department where you would like them.
	   					   NOTE: The rules prohibit a player from placing his UNASSIGNED players in a department chaired by another player.
	   					   		 Students cannot be taken back if placed in a department by accident. 
	   		
	   		*Transfer: This is the time for you to move your students around from one department to another if you wish to do so. NOTE: You
	   			       You cannot transfer students just anywhere. Adjacency rules are in effect and the game will not give you the option
	   			       to transfer a student to a non adjacent department. All departments within the same school are adjacent. All other
	   			       adjacencies are denoted by connecting lines on the game board. For your reference, the external adjacencies are as
	   			       follows:
	   			                             Business <--> Civil
	   			                             Computer <--> Linguistics
	   			                             Religion <--> Mathematics
	   			                             Physics <--> Music
	   			                             Visual Arts <--> Mechanical
	   			                             Chemistry <--> Anesthesia
	   			                             Pathology <--> Criminal
	   			                             
	   			       A player may transfer as many students at a time as he wishes. The player cannot transfer all the students from the department,
	   			       at least one student must remain in the department. When a player clicks on transfer, a menu appears and the player is given an option on 
	   			       how many students he/she wants to move through a drop down menu. Another drop down menu displays the departments that are possible 
	   			       for students to be moved. When the player has made his/her selection on amount of students and the department, click ok and the gameboard
	   			       will update the students being moved. Click x on the top to exit and resume. (For the grader: we are sorry that we could not get the game
	   			       to transfer students from one dept to another in a different school. It was working originally but we then got a nullpointerexception
	   			       that we did not have the time or resources to work out. If you can do it, that's pretty amazing. Sorry, though. Our game is perfect otherwise ;))
	   		
	   		*Election: This is the time where a player, if he/she wishes, can initiate an election for control of a department. The player
	   				   will be prompted as to what department they wish to run for election for. The students in the department will vote
	   				   for which player they would like to become chair, and the winner automatically becomes the chair of that department
	   				   and all students in that department then belong to, or are loyal to, the winner of that election.	
	   				 				                                 		   
	   		*Information Box: On the bottom right corner is an information box. The information displayed corresponds to the player who is making their turn. The
	   						  box will display a list of departments and show how many students the player placed in each department. 
	   				 				                                 		   
	  --> The game will be over when one Player is President of the University. This requires that the Player be Dean of every school,
	  	  which requires that the Player is chair of every department in the University.
